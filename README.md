# Revenue Distribution Optimization for Short-Stay Accommodations

## Challenge Overview

Dear Evaluator,

Welcome to the evaluation of my submission for the "Revenue Distribution Optimization for Short-Stay Accommodations" project. Below are the instructions to understand, test, and assess the components of the project.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Handling and Analysis (Python):

- The core functionality is implemented in `data_analysis.py`.
- To review the data analysis code, please refer to the file.

### 2. API (Optional):

- The optional API functionality is implemented in `api.py`.
- To assess the API, refer to the corresponding file.

### 3. Code Review:

- Code review insights and next steps are documented in `CODE_REVIEW.md`.
- Please review the provided feedback.

### 4. System Architecture Drawing:

- The system architecture is visualized in `architecture_diagram.png`.
- Examine the diagram for an overview of the MVP's structure.

### 5. Presentation:

- The project presentation is available in `presentation.pptx`.
- It covers all the required elements.

### 6. GitHub Repository:

- The entire project is hosted on a public GitHub repository.
- Access the repository at [GitHub Repository](<URL_of_your_repository>).

## How to Evaluate

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Review the clarity, organization, and efficiency of the Python code in `data_analysis.py` and `api.py`.
   - Check for adherence to best practices and the absence of common issues.

2. **Code Review Insights:**
   - Analyze the code review document (`CODE_REVIEW.md`) for insights into self-assessment and identified improvements.

3. **System Architecture:**
   - Examine the system architecture diagram (`architecture_diagram.png`) for a high-level understanding of the project structure.

4. **Presentation:**
   - Refer to the project presentation (`presentation.pptx`) to gain insights into the thought process, decision-making, and overall project explanation.

5. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Assess the organization and documentation within the GitHub repository.
   - Review the README.md for clear instructions on setting up and running the project.

## Running the Project (Quick Test)

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure Python and Visual Studio Code are installed.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git clone <URL_of_your_repository>
     cd revenue_optimization
     ```

3. **Testing Data Reading:**
   - Run a quick test to check data reading:

     ```bash
     python
     from data_analysis import read_booking_data
     data = read_booking_data('booking_data.csv')
     print(data)
     ```

4. **Evaluate API (if implemented):**
   - If the API is implemented, follow the documentation in `api.py` and check its functionality.

5. **Reviewing Code and Documentation:**
   - Read through the code in `data_analysis.py` and `api.py`.
   - Review the README.md for any additional instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluate based on the quality of the code, code review practices, effectiveness of the architectural design, and clarity of the presentation. Additionally, consider the organization and documentation within the GitHub repository.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
